Hi there, This is my Puzzle_Cam Project, which is basically a Puzzle Game which uses Video feed from the camera and after successful shuffle it shows the Score.

• Used HTML, CSS and Java Script.

• It is Responsive.

• Explored about Image Manipulation, Working with Sound, Advanced Cropping and Interface Design.
